describe a way to automatically test the app

The webservice calls should be translated into class methods in order to create 'fakes'.
Interesting and edge case data sets could then be introduced thru the webservice class methods when running the end-to-end tests.


how the design of the end-to-end service + app should change if the dataset were three orders of magnitude larger

The end-to-end service could serve up a sorted list via a stored procedure; therefore minimal processing on the app side would be required.
The app: Since the webservice calls appear to be the 'long pole', the calls should be parallelized thru multi-threading.
The coalescing of the data would then need to employ a mutex.
