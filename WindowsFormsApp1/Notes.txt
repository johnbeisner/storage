We have a simple web service that exposes some dummy people data (id, name, age, number, photo, bio).
The goal is to make an app that consumes this service and displays the 5 youngest users with valid us 
telephone numbers sorted by name.
The UI for displaying the results is up to you --- this is a backend project so we don’t worry too much about the UI.
You can use any third party packages / plugins / frameworks you like, and contact us with any questions.
We are interested in the cleanness of code design and implementation.
For “extra credit”, describe a way to automatically test the app and how the design of the end-to-end 
service + app should change if the dataset were three orders of magnitude larger. Thanks.
